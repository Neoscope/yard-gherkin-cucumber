    <div id="content"><div id='filecontents'><h1>YARD-Cucumber: A Requirements Documentation Tool</h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>YARD-Cucumber (formerly Cucumber-In-The-Yard) is a YARD extension that processes
Cucumber features, scenarios, steps, tags, step definitions, and even transforms
to provide documentation similar to what you expect to how YARD displays
classes, methods and constants.This tools bridges the gap of having feature
files found in your source code and true documentation that your team, product
owners and stakeholders can use.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>I have created a trivial, example project to help provide a quick
visualization of the resulting documentation. I encourage you to look at it as
an example and see if it would assist your project from a multitude of
perspectives: as the project&#39;s core developer; another developer or a new
developer; quality assurance engineer; or product owner/stakeholder.</p>

<p>The implemented example has been deployed at <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/">http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1. View Features and Scenarios</strong> <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/requirements.html">example</a></p>

<p><strong>2. Search through <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/feature_list.html">features, scenarios</a>, and <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/tag_list.html">tags</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Dynamic Tag Unions and Intersections</strong> <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/requirements/tags.html">example</a></p>

<p><strong>4. View all features and scenarios by tag</strong> <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/requirements/tags/bvt.html">example</a></p>

<p><strong>5. View Step Definitions and Transforms</strong> <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/requirements/step_transformers.html">example</a></p>

<p><strong>6. All steps <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/requirements/step_transformers.html#definition_5-stepdefinition">matched</a> to step definitions</strong></p>

<p><strong>7. <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/requirements/step_transformers.html#step_transform7-steptransform">Steps</a> that have transforms applied to them</strong></p>

<p><strong>8. <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/requirements/step_transformers.html#undefined_steps">Undefined steps</a> and even <a href="http://rubular.com/">Rubular</a> links of your step definitions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>9. Feature directories with a README.md will be parsed into the description</strong> <a href="http://franklinwebber.com/cukes/requirements/example/child_feature.html">example</a></p>

<p><strong>10. Configurable Menus - want a searchable steps menu and remove the tags menu</strong></p>

<p><strong>11. Step definitions in your language (Ruby 1.9.2 - Internationalization)</strong></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>YARD-Cucumber requires the following gems installed:</p>

<p>Gherkin 2.2.9 - <a href="http://cukes.info">http://cukes.info</a>
Cucumber 0.7.5 - <a href="http://cukes.info">http://cukes.info</a>
YARD 0.8.1 - <a href="http://yardoc.org">http://yardoc.org</a></p>

<p>To install <code>yard-cucumber</code> use the following command:</p>

<pre class="code bash"><code class="bash">$ gem install yard-cucumber
</code></pre>

<p>(Add <code>sudo</code> if you&#39;re installing under a POSIX system as root)</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>YARD supports for automatically including gems with the prefix <code>yard-</code>
as a plugin. To enable automatic loading yard-cucumber.</p>

<pre class="code bash"><code class="bash">$ mkdir ~/.yard
$ yard config load_plugins true
$ yardoc &#39;example/**/*.rb&#39; &#39;example/**/*.feature&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can run YARD as you <a href="https://github.com/lsegal/yard">normally</a> would and
have your features, step definitions and transforms captured.</p>

<p>An example with the rake task:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_require'>require</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>yard</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>

<span class='const'>YARD</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>Rake</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>YardocTask</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_new'>new</span> <span class='kw'>do</span> <span class='op'>|</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_t'>t</span><span class='op'>|</span>

<span class='id identifier rubyid_t'>t</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id identifier rubyid_options'>options</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='lbracket'>[</span><span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>--any</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>--extra</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='comma'>,</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>--opts</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span><span class='rbracket'>]</span> <span class='comment'># optional
</span><span class='kw'>end</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<ul>
<li>Adding or Removing search fields (yardoc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Be default the yardoc output will generate a search field for features and tags.
This can be configured through the yard configuration file <code>~/.yard/config</code> to
add or remove these search fields.</p>

<pre class="code yaml"><code class="yaml">--- !map:SymbolHash
:load_plugins: true
:ignored_plugins: []

:autoload_plugins: []

:safe_mode: false

:&quot;yard-cucumber&quot;:
  menus: [ &#39;features&#39;, &#39;directories&#39;, &#39;tags&#39;, &#39;steps&#39;, &#39;step definitions&#39; ]
</code></pre>

<p>By default the configuration, yaml format, that is generate by the <code>yard config</code>
command will save a <code>SymbolHash</code>. You can still edit this file add the entry for
<code>:&quot;yard-cucumber&quot;:</code> and the sub-entry <code>menus:</code> which can contain all of the above
mentioned menus or simply an empty array <code>[]</code> if you want no additional menus.</p>

<ul>
<li>Step definitions in your language (Ruby 1.9.2)</li>
</ul>

<p>Again the yard configuration file you can define additional step definitions
that can be matched.</p>

<pre class="code yaml"><code class="yaml">:&quot;yard-cucumber&quot;:
  language:
    step_definitions: [ &#39;Given&#39;, &#39;When&#39;, &#39;Then&#39;, &#39;And&#39;, &#39;Soit&#39;, &#39;Etantdonn√©&#39;, &#39;Lorsque&#39;, &#39;Lorsqu&#39;, &#39;Alors&#39;, &#39;Et&#39; ]
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, I have included the French step definition words alongside the
English step definitions. Even without specifying this feature files in other
languages are found, this provides the ability for the step definitions to match
correctly to step definitions.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>There are two things that I enjoy: a test framework written in my own Domain
Specific Language (DSL) that is easily understood by all those on a project
and the ability for all participants to easily read, search, and view the tests.</p>

<p>Cucumber is an amazing tool that allowed me to define exercisable requirements.
My biggest obstacle was bringing these requirements to my team, the product
owner, and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>Initially I tried to expose more of the functionality by providing freshly
authored requirements through email, attachments to JIRA tickets, or linked in
wiki documents. None of these methods were very sustainable or successful.
First, I was continually pushing out the documents to those interested.
Second, the documents were displayed to the user in text without the syntax
highlighting that was exceedingly helpful for quickly understanding the requirements.</p>

<p>I also found it hard to share the test framework that I had put together with
another developer that joined the team. It was difficult to direct them around
the features, tags, step definitions, and transforms. It was when I started to
convey to them the conventions that I had established that I wished I had a
tool that would allow me to provide documentation like one would find generated
by a great tool like YARD.</p>

<p>So I set out to integrate Cucumber objects like features, backgrounds,
scenarios, tags, steps, step definitions, and transforms into a YARD template.
From my quick survey of the landscape I can see that the my needs are
different than a lot of others that use Cucumber.  The entire project that
spawned this effort was solely to exercise the functionality of a different,
large project and so there is a huge dependence on having the requirements
documented.  This is in contrast to other projects that are using this on a
small scale to test the functionality of small software component.  Though,
ultimately, I realized that the functionality may provide a valuable tool for
many as I feel it helps more solidly bridge the reporting of the documentation
by putting a coat of paint on it.</p>
