=== 1.4 / 2010-10

* Tagusage has been retired
* Tags are found during parsing by name or created and all uses are appended to the exising or newly created object
* Tagusage template renamed and fixed up for just a tag and all the references
* Tags are named tag_TAG (removed the @ as it was encoded during file serialization and I couldn't find an encoder helper)
* Cleaned up all references in the fulldoc, full list to references tags

=== 1.3 / 2010-10-13

* (7rans requested) Step definitions to show their source code; required a better source definition to be stored during creation of the CodeObject
* Fixes to the Feature template which had some unclosed table header elements
* Scenario Outline helper methods added to Scenarios
* Scenario Outlines, Tables, and Multiline Strings had other minor CSS changes
* Step tables and Scenario Example tables are no longer locked to 150px; instead that is the minimum width
* Tables and Multiline Strings (PyStrings) are no longer displayed in the steps frame which was causing ugliness with the striping of the rows
* (lsegal strongly recommended) Removed the pervasive use of filename in the CodeObjects
* Cleaned up the fulldoc setup to remove the redundancy
* Updated all the templates to support the lack of filename
