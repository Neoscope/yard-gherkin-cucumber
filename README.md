Cucumber-In-The-YARD (CITY): A Requirements Documentation Tool
====================================

Synopsis
--------

Cucumber-In-The-Yard is a YARD extension that processes Cucumber Features, Scenarios, Steps,
Step Definitions, Transforms, and Tags and provides a documentation interface that allows you
easily view and investigate the test suite.  This tools hopes to bridge the gap of being able
to provide your feature descriptions to your Product Owners and Stakeholders.

Example
-------

An example, particularly the example features included with the project, of CITY can be viewed at

   [http://recursivegames.com/cukes/](http://recursivegames.com/cukes/)    

**1. Users are able to search by Feature, Tags, and Scenario.**

Appended to the traditional search areas is the ability to now search by Feature, Tag, and Scenario.
The user is able to search by steps, though I have not placed those links on the page, in step_list.html
found in the root of the output directory.

**2. Feature pages are displayed in a decently formatted HTML representation**

As opposed to pointing team members, stakeholders, and product owners to feature files which require 
an editor with syntax highlighting.  As well as providing the ability to quickly follow tags and steps 
for more information.

**3. Tag pages display all the Features and scenarios that currently employ the tag.**

Providing quick access to the important tag divisions that have been created in a project.  
On the top of the page there are some quick calculations of the number of features and scenarios that
share the specified tag. 

**4. Steps link to Step definitions.  Step definitions show all uses.**

Step definitions are displayed in their own index page and for each step definition a list of implemented
steps for this step definition.  This is useful for providing example documentation and quickly understanding
which scenarios are affected by a change to a step definition.

**5. Step Transforms are displayed as links in the step definitions**

After finding the Step to Step Definition link it looks at the match groups within the step and find which
ones match the step transforms.  Step transform links can be found after following a link from the step to 
the step definition.

**6. Highlight the sections of steps that match in the step definition**

Steps highlight the match groups in a different color to show which parts of the step are matched in the step
definition.



Installation
------------

Cucumber-In-The-Yard (CITY) requires the following gems installed:

    Gherkin - http://cukes.info
    Cucumber - http://cukes.info
    YARD - http://yardoc.org

To install CITY use the following command:

    $ gem install cucumber-in-the-yard
    
(Add `sudo` if you're installing under a POSIX system as root)

Alternatively, if you've checked the source out directly, you can call 
`rake install` from the root project directory.


Usage
-----

**1. Rake Task**

You can do this by adding the following to your `Rakefile`:
    
    require "yard"
    require "city"

    YARD::Rake::CitydocTask.new do |t|
      t.files   = ['features/**/*.feature', 'features/**/*.rb', OTHER_PATHS]   # optional
      t.options = ['--any', '--extra', '--opts'] # optional
    end

both the `files` and `options` settings are optional. `files` will default to
`lib/**/*.rb` and `options` will represents any options you might want
to add. Again, a full list of options is available by typing `yardoc --help`
in a shell. You can also override the options at the Rake command-line with the
OPTS environment variable:


Details
--------

There are two things that I enjoy: a test framework written in my own Domain Specific Language (DSL)
that is easily understood by all those on a project and the ability for all participants to easily read, 
search, and view the tests.

Cucumber is an amazing tool that allowed me to define exercisable requirements.  My biggest obstacle was
bringing these requirements to my team, the product owner, and other stakeholders.

Initially I tried to expose more of the functionality by providing freshly authored requirements through 
email, attachments to JIRA tickets, or linked in wiki documents.  None of these methods were very sustainable 
or successful.  First, I was continually pushing out the documents to those interested.  Second, the documents were displayed to the user in text without the syntax highlighting that was exceedingly helpful for quickly understanding the requirements.

I also found it hard to share the test framework that I had put together with another developer that joined 
the team.  It was difficult to direct them around the features, tags, step definitions, and transforms.  
It was when I started to convey to them the conventions that I had established that I wished I had a tool 
that would allow me to provide documentation like one would find generated by a great tool like YARD.

So I set out to integrate Cucumber objects like features, backgrounds, scenarios, tags, steps, step 
definitions, and transforms into a YARD template.  From my quick survey of the landscape I can see that the 
my needs are different than a lot of others that use Cucumber.  The entire project that spawned this effort 
was solely to exercise the functionality of a different, large project and so there is a huge dependence on
having the requirements documented.  This is in contrast to other projects that are using this on a small 
scale to test the functionality of small software component.  Though, ultimately, I realized that the 
functionality may provide a valuable tool for many as I feel it helps more solidly bridge the reporting of 
the documentation by putting a coat of paint on it.

Roadmap
-------

**Future Feature Ideas**

**1. Represent instances of scenarios for scenario outlines.**

Display all the values that would normally be substituted into a scenario for the scenario outline. To 
make it easier to represent them to product owners.  As well as link the instance of the step definitions
for developers.

**2. Tag pages provide the ability to exclude other tags that intersect.**

Adding a list of tags currently used by the features and scenarios in the below list (that are not the
current tag).  Allowing the visualization of what the execution of the requirements pass would look like.
Output of a sample generated tag command-line would be displayed to assist with execution.  On selection
update of the total features and scenarios affected by the changes in the filtering.

I would like to also address some layout and formatting on the page.  Scenarios will also link to the scenarios
feature page, show their descriptions, and of course all their other tags.

**3. Performance enhancements**

At the current rate the documentation generation is dreadfully slow for the project.  After implementing a few 
more of these features I will look at addressing the performance to see where this can be optimized.
