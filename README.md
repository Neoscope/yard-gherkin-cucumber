Cucumber-In-The-YARD (CITY): A Requirements Documentation Tool
====================================

Synopsis
--------

Cucumber-In-The-Yard is a YARD extension that processes Cucumber Features, Scenarios, Steps,
Step Definitions, Transforms, and Tags and provides a documentation interface that allows you
easily view and investigate the test suite.  This tools hopes to bridge the gap of being able
to provide your feature descriptions to your Product Owners and Stakeholders.


Installation
------------

Cucumber-In-The-Yard (CITY) requires the following gems installed:

    Gherkin - http://cukes.info
    Cucumber - http://cukes.info
    YARD - http://yardoc.org

To install CITY use the following command:

    $ gem install cucumber-in-the-yard
    
(Add `sudo` if you're installing under a POSIX system as root)

Alternatively, if you've checked the source out directly, you can call 
`rake install` from the root project directory.


Usage
-----

**1. Rake Task**

You can do this by adding the following to your `Rakefile`:
    
    require "yard"
    require "city"

    YARD::Rake::CitydocTask.new do |t|
      t.files   = ['features/**/*.feature', 'features/**/*.rb', OTHER_PATHS]   # optional
      t.options = ['--any', '--extra', '--opts'] # optional
    end

both the `files` and `options` settings are optional. `files` will default to
`lib/**/*.rb` and `options` will represents any options you might want
to add. Again, a full list of options is available by typing `yardoc --help`
in a shell. You can also override the options at the Rake command-line with the
OPTS environment variable:


Details
--------

There are two things that I enjoy: a test framework written in my own Domain Specific Language (DSL)
that is easily understood by all those on a project and the ability for all participants to easily read, 
search, and view the tests.

Cucumber is an amazing tool that allowed me to define exercisable requirements.  My biggest obstacle was
bringing these requirements to my team, the product owner, and other stakeholders.

Initially I tried to expose more of the functionality by providing freshly authored requirements through 
email, attachments to JIRA tickets, or linked in wiki documents.  None of these methods were very sustainable 
or successful.  First, I was continually pushing out the documents to those interested.  Second, the documents were displayed to the user in text without the syntax highlighting that was exceedingly helpful for quickly understanding the requirements.

I also found it hard to share the test framework that I had put together with another developer that joined 
the team.  It was difficult to direct them around the features, tags, step definitions, and transforms.  
It was when I started to convey to them the conventions that I had established that I wished I had a tool 
that would allow me to provide documentation like one would find generated by a great tool like YARD.

So I set out to integrate Cucumber objects like features, backgrounds, scenarios, tags, steps, step 
definitions, and transforms into a YARD template.  From my quick survey of the landscape I can see that the 
my needs are different than a lot of others that use Cucumber.  The entire project that spawned this effort 
was solely to exercise the functionality of a different, large project and so there is a huge dependence on
having the requirements documented.  This is in contrast to other projects that are using this on a small 
scale to test the functionality of small software component.  Though, ultimately, I realized that the 
functionality may provide a valuable tool for many as I feel it helps more solidly bridge the reporting of 
the documentation by putting a coat of paint on it.


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

**1. Searchable Features, Scenarios, Steps, and Tags**: Similar to how YARD provides the ability to search through classes and methods, CITY provides the ability to search through all of the requirements documentation quickly and easily through the browser.  This makes it easy to provide reports for product owners and other stakeholders.

**2. Tags**: Tag view will show all features and scenarios that employ the tag.

**3. Steps map to Step Definitions**: Steps provide links to their step definitions so developers and maintainers of the requirements suite can quickly find their way around the project.  As well, step definitions report all their implemented step definitions to provide a quick way of understanding the impact of augmenting a step definition as well as providing examples.
