This collection of features are really just to test some of the varied cases
that CITY may come in contact with while parsing a series of features.  All
of the features, tags, and directories displayed here are contained in this 
directory and all subdirectories.

* First, the features which are broken down alphabetically and displayed
* Second, the tags, used by all the features and scenarios
* Third, the subdirectories, contained in this directory and in the subdirectories.
